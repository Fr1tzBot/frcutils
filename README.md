### a bunch of util scripts for frc

- Data Sources:
    1. Blue Alliance API:
        - scripts use an api key placed in the .apiKey file
    2. Blue Alliance Web Scraping:
        - used in many older scripts
        - used for some data that can't be pulled from the API
    3. frcElo (WIP):
        - scripts pull latest dataset from github
    4. statbotics.io API (WIP):
        - grabs data from statbotics
    5. SykesEventSim (WIP):
        - scripts pull latest sheet from github and interact with it
    6. SykesScoutingDB (WIP):

- Todo:
    - clean up data folder
    - remove old web scraping scripts
